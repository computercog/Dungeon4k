Dungeon4k is a game written in java, and looks similar to games like Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder.
It was written by Markus Persson as an entry for a java 4KB game programming competition.

-Play-
------

The original .jar is included, but I recommend that you use the updated one.
To launch the original, run "java -cp Dungeon4k.jar D window" or execute the "run.bat" file to run the game.
To launch the updated version, all you need to do is double click on the .jar file.
Please note that no matter which version you use, the game will capture your cursor until you exit the game.

-Instructions-
--------------
The goal of Dungeon4k is to collect as many diamonds as possible before the energy runs out.
To do this, you will need to find keys for locked doors, refill your energy, and cast powerful spells.

-------
-Items-
-------
Door: 
To open a door, either use a key by simply walking into the door, or cast the BREAK spell.

Key: 
walk over to a key to pick it up. They are found on the ground scattered across the dungeon.

Diamond: 
Walk over to a diamond to pick it up. Each diamond you pick up is worth one point more than the last.

Power stone: 
Power stones litter the hallways of the dungeon, blocking your passage.
You can push them into an empty space by walking into them, break them with the BREAK spell, or pull them towards you with the PULL spell. (Make sure there's an empty tile between you and the power stone you wish to PULL)

Power field (uncharged):
Appearing as white particles, power fields are special tiles where the air is tingling with power. Push a power stone into a pwoer field to break down the stone and make the field absorb the power in the stone.

Power field (charged):
Appearing as white and red particles, a charged power field will replenish some of your energy when you step into  it.
